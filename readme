# Heart Disease Prediction App

This is a full-stack machine learning app for predicting heart disease risk. It includes a Python backend for model inference and a frontend built with modern JavaScript tooling (Vite + pnpm).

---

## Quickstart: Local Setup

This guide walks you through setting up the project on a fresh machine.

---

### Requirements

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js 16.9+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Corepack (comes with Node 16.9+)](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html)

---

## 1. Clone the Repo and Switch to `master` Branch

git clone https://github.com/ChicoState/heartdisease.git

cd heartdisease
git checkout master
cd hdrd

---

2. Set Up Python Backend

> Create a virtual environment and install backend dependencies.

### Python Version Compatibility

##### For macOS (with Homebrew):

# Install Python 3.9 (or later)
brew install python@3.9

# Verify installation
python3.9 --version
# Should show Python 3.9.x or higher

brew link python@3.9 --force --overwrite

Once Python 3.9 is installed, create a virtual environment:

# Create a virtual environment using Python 3.9
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip to the latest version
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install the required Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
---

## 3. Set Up Frontend with pnpm

> We use `pnpm` (a fast Node.js package manager), managed through Corepack so users don't need global installs.

### Enable Corepack:
corepack enable

### Install dependencies:
pnpm install

### Start the frontend dev server:
pnpm dev

> This will start the frontend on [http://localhost:3000]

---

## You're all set!

Your app should now be running locally.
